### What I learned
After taking 21 days course by Kelvin Powell on Conquering Responsive Design, I decided to do some practing by taking up this challenge. I learnt responsive design while doing the project, mobile first approach to be precise, which helped me write less css code. I must admit doing this project was really difficult for me to accomplish, but am i learnt alot in the process.
### Useful resources
